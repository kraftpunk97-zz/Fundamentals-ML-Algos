# Fundamentals-of-ML

A collection of elementary ML Regression and classification, and clustering algorithms that I wrote to get a better feel of how the gears turn behind our favorite algorithms. It's your good ol' Python and Numpy (with guest appearances from Matplotlib, when a picture says a thousand words). It's probably a mess, so sorry for that.

This is where I started. I have since moved on to greater things.
